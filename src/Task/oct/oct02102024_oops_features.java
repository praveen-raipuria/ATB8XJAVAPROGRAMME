OOPS (Object oriented Programing Structure)

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects,"
which can contain data and methods. The four main pillars of OOP are:

Inheritance: This allows a new class to inherit properties and behavior
 (methods) from an existing class. It promotes code reuse.
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties (fields) and behavior (methods) of another class,
 known as the parent or superclass. It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between
 classes, helping to manage and reduce redundancy.

Polymorphism: It enables one interface to be used for a general class of actions.
 The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation (e.g.,
 method overloading and method overriding).

Polymorphism means "many forms" and allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class
rather than their actual class. There are two types of polymorphism:
Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading): Multiple methods
 can have the same name with different parameters.
Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding): A subclass can provide a
 specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (attributes) and code (methods) together
 into a single unit, known as a class.
It hides the internal state and behavior of the object,
 only exposing essential features through methods, which promotes data security and integrity.

Abstraction: Abstraction allows the representation of essential features
 without including background details or explanations. In OOP,
  it simplifies complex systems by breaking them down into smaller,
  more manageable parts, and provides only relevant information to the user
   while hiding the underlying implementation.

OOP is a programming paradigm based on four main principles: inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.");
