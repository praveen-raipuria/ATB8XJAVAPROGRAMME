//        class

//        class is not a real world entity.it is just a template or blueprint or prototype from which object are created
//        collection of objects is called class
//        A class in java can contain -field,methods,constructors,blocks,nested class and interface
//        it has attributes and behaviours
//        Everything in class can only be declared ones

//        object

//        objects are instances of a class that have actual values for the properties defined in classes
//        they are physical entities
//        objects can be created many times as per requirement
//        the 3 characteristics of object are state,behaviour and identity.
